# Server Information Analysis

A Summer Internship Task.
Basically, I was given a task to make a web site having two parts, trend analysis and live view.

In live view, the live status of the server will be provided and you may export and download it in excel also.
In trend analysis, you will be provided with the company's server performance trends based on four factors: - CPU and memory, TempDB size, Multiple server sessions and top expensive queries.

On the basis of these , charts or other demographics will be shown fetching the information in between a particular time interval and go on to show it nicely.


The code is almost completely commented,exccept some portions.
A user manual is also provided for help.
